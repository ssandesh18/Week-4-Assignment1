    "A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values. It’s not an idea anymore, it’s an actual dog, like a dog of breed pug who’s seven years old. You can have many dogs to create many different instances, but without the class as a guide, you would be lost, not knowing what information is required.\n",
    "An object consists of:\n",
    "State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.\n",
    "Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.\n",
    "Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.\n",

The __init__ method takes name and age parameters and assigns them to the name and age attributes of the object being created. init function is a constructor\n",

    "Q4. Why self is used in OOPs? \n",
    "\n",
    "The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and is used to access variables that belong to the class.It does not have to be named self , you can call it whatever you like, but it has to be the first parameter of any function in the class\n",
    "When working with classes in Python, the term “self” refers to the instance of the class that is currently being used. It is customary to use “self” as the first parameter in instance methods of a class. Whenever you call a method of an object created from a clas, the object is automatically passed as the first argument using the “self” parameter. This enables you to modify the object’s properties and execute tasks unique to that particular instance\n"
